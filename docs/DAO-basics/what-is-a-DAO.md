# What is a DAO?

## Summary

The term "DAO" is an acronym for "decentralized autonomous organization" - a new form of organization that enables a distributed group to coordinate through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain. 

DAOs represent an evolution in organizational structure for the digital age. As more social and economic activity moves online, humans need new ways of coordinating around a shared mission in a trusted manner. Blockchains - given that they are inherently transparent, lack a centralized authority, and are opt-in by nature - are a new tool that enable distributed individuals to coordinate in a decentralized fashion. DAOs are an outgrowth of this innovation, applied to organizations.
