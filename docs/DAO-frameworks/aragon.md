# Aragon 

## Summary

Aragon is a project that offers templates, guides and other services to create and manage DAOs on the Ethereum blockchain.
With the largest number of DAOs created using the Aragon framework, it currently leads the undestry in facilitating the creation and management of DAOs.

## How to Aragon:

Its services range from easily creating DAOs, aiding with the UI and OS used by the DAO, as well as offering a judicial framework within which DAOs can resolve disputes without central authorities.
This network of services is currently transitioning from Aragon V1 to Aragon V2 yet, the principal services as of now are introduced below:

#### Creating A DAO

Using [Aragon Client](https://aragon.org/client) you can create your own DAO in five steps for less than $10 USD in Eth.

First, you are presented with six governance templates which you can choose from depending on the type of organization you wish to create.
After naming your organization, you may edit the initial template so it best fits your organization's needs.
Although each template has its own suite of smart-contracts, the editing process allows you to further tailor the parameters that administer and structure your DAO.

Aragon Client is trasitioning to [Aragon Govern](https://aragon.org/govern) within V2

#### Dispute Resolution

The [Aragon Court](https://aragon.org/old/court) facilitates consensus and dispute resolution in a decentralized manner.
To do so it incentivizes jurors to participate by voting on rulings. The system abides according to a logic of majority rule such that, jurors who vote in favor of the final ruling are rewarded with the fees taken from juror's who voted for the minority ruling.

To use this service Aragon's native ANT tokens must be converted to the ANJ token, however, with V2 the ANJ token is being [integrated](https://upgrade.aragon.org/#/) into the ANT token.\
In parallel, Aragon Court is transitioning to [Aragon Protocol](https://aragon.org/protocol) whereby, other than transitioning from ANJ to ANT, othe jurors will be known as guardians who will be rewarded in ANT for their judicial participation in the network. 

#### Voting, Coordination and Communication

Aragon recently announced the launch [Aragon Voice](https://aragon.org/aragon-voice), a solution for creating and managing proposals in a "decentralized, cost effective and secure manner." \

Its primary feature is free and secure voting supporting a wide variety of voting types.
