## Contribution Guidelines

In the interest of keeping the content on Stateless looking uniform, we have set up a template that you can use when adding your own pages to the github repo. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/stateless-io/stateless/tree/138f04335ad4a090d8eb370a9af90ee82fccf1a6/template.md).

There are also some basic guidelines that need to be followed when contributing to Stateless:

* All pages should have links to supporting sources/documentation and additional resources
* No marketing or sponsored posts
* No promotion of ICOs/token sales
* No inappropriate content
