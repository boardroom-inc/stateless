Summary The term \"DAO\" is an acronym for \"decentralized autonomous organization\" - a new form of organization that enables a distributed group to coordinate through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs represent an evolution in organizational structure for the digital age. As more social and economic activity moves online, humans need new ways of coordinating around a shared mission in a trusted manner. Blockchains - given that they are inherently transparent, lack a centralized authority, and are opt-in by nature - are a new tool that enable distributed individuals to coordinate in a decentralized fashion.

With the largest number of DAOs created using the Aragon framework, it currently leads the undestry in facilitating the creation and management of DAOs. How to Aragon: Its services range from easily creating DAOs, aiding with the UI and OS used by the DAO, as well as offering a judicial framework within which DAOs can resolve disputes without central authorities. This network of services is currently transitioning from Aragon V1 to Aragon V2 yet, the principal services as of now are introduced below: - Read more about V2 Changes here Creating A DAO Using Aragon Client you can create your own DAO in five steps for less than $10 USD in Eth. First, you are presented with six governance templates which you can choose from depending on the type of organization you wish to create. After naming your organization, you may edit the initial template so it best fits your organization's needs. Although each template has its own suite of smart-contracts, the editing process allows you to further tailor the parameters that administer and structure your DAO. Aragon Client is trasitioning to Aragon Govern within V2 To learn more about building your DAO with aragorn read this article. Dispute Resolution The Aragon Court facilitates consensus and dispute resolution in a decentralized manner. To do so it incentivizes jurors to participate by voting on rulings. The system abides according to a logic of majority rule such that, jurors who vote in favor of the final ruling are rewarded with the fees taken from juror's who voted for the minority ruling. To use this service Aragon's native ANT tokens must be converted to the ANJ token, however, with V2 the ANJ token is being integrated into the ANT token.\\ In parallel, Aragon Court is transitioning to Aragon Protocol whereby, other than transitioning from ANJ to ANT, othe jurors will be known as guardians who will be rewarded in ANT for their judicial participation in the network.

They are essentially consensus protocols, which means that different nodes in the network (e.g. computers on the internet) have to be running compatible software. \u201cNode operators\u201d are the owners and managers of nodes that run the protocol. Most node operators don\u2019t want to write much software, and it\u2019s a technical challenge for anyone to independently write compatible implementations of any consensus protocol even if they have a specification. As a result, node operators rely on software repositories (usually hosted on Microsoft/Github servers) to provide them with the software they choose to run. \u201cCore developers\u201d of a blockchain are software developers who work on the software that implement that protocol. Developers have processes that are supposed to assure the quality of the software they release, and are generally very interested in maintaining the legitimacy of their software repositories because they want to see people using their software (as opposed to someone else\u2019s). Critical Components of Governance 1. Incentives Each group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power. 2. Mechanisms for Coordination Since it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another, it creates power imbalances in their favor. In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains (such as Tezos or Polkadot), on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed. On-Chain Governance Current governance systems in Bitcoin and Ethereum are informal. They were designed using a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original paper. Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). What is on-chain governance? On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change. How does it work? Unlike informal governance systems, which use a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems solely work online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. If the change is accepted, it is included in the blockchain and baselined. In some instances of on-chain governance implementation, the updated code may be rolled back to its version before a baseline, if the proposed change is unsuccessful. Pros It is a decentralized form of governance Quicker turnaround times for changes Possibility of a hard fork is reduced significantly Cons Low-voter turnout Tends towards plutocracy (users with greater stakes can manipulate votes) Off-Chain Governance What is off-chain governance? Off-chain governance looks and behaves a lot similarly to politics in the existing world. Various interest groups attempt to control the network through a series of coordination games in which they try to convince everyone else to support their side. There is no code that binds these groups to specific behaviors, but rather, they choose what\u2019s in their best interest given the known preferences of the other stakeholders. There\u2019s a reason blockchain technology and game theory are so interwoven. How does it work? Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). The various stakeholders signal their approval or disapproval for an improvement proposal through private and community discourse. Then, the core developers get a sense for whether or not node operators and miners will agree to upgrade their software. Ideally, all sides agree and the code changes are made smoothly. Everything is announced beforehand and stakeholders have time to update. In the case of disagreement, stakeholders have two options. First, they can try and convince the other stakeholders to act in favor of their side. If they can\u2019t reach consensus, they have the ability to hard fork the protocol and keep or change features they think are necessary. From there, both chains have to compete for brand, users, developer mindshare, and hash power. Resources Why on-chain governance?

Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change.","title":"What is on-chain governance?"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#how-does-it-work","text":"Unlike informal governance systems, which use a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems solely work online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. If the change is accepted, it is included in the blockchain and baselined. In some instances of on-chain governance implementation, the updated code may be rolled back to its version before a baseline, if the proposed change is unsuccessful.","title":"How does it work?"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#pros","text":"It is a decentralized form of governance Quicker turnaround times for changes Possibility of a hard fork is reduced significantly","title":"Pros"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#cons","text":"Low-voter turnout Tends towards plutocracy (users with greater stakes can manipulate votes)","title":"Cons"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#off-chain-governance","text":"","title":"Off-Chain Governance"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#what-is-off-chain-governance","text":"Off-chain governance looks and behaves a lot similarly to politics in the existing world. Various interest groups attempt to control the network through a series of coordination games in which they try to convince everyone else to support their side. There is no code that binds these groups to specific behaviors, but rather, they choose what\u2019s in their best interest given the known preferences of the other stakeholders. There\u2019s a reason blockchain technology and game theory are so interwoven.","title":"What is off-chain governance?"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#how-does-it-work_1","text":"Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). The various stakeholders signal their approval or disapproval for an improvement proposal through private and community discourse. Then, the core developers get a sense for whether or not node operators and miners will agree to upgrade their software. Ideally, all sides agree and the code changes are made smoothly. Everything is announced beforehand and stakeholders have time to update. In the case of disagreement, stakeholders have two options. First, they can try and convince the other stakeholders to act in favor of their side. If they can\u2019t reach consensus, they have the ability to hard fork the protocol and keep or change features they think are necessary. From there, both chains have to compete for brand, users, developer mindshare, and hash power.","title":"How does it work?"},{"location":"Governance/what-does-governance-mean%3F/#resources","text":"Why on-chain governance?
