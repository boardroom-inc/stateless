They are essentially consensus protocols, which means that different nodes in the network (e.g. computers on the internet) have to be running compatible software. \u201cNode operators\u201d are the owners and managers of nodes that run the protocol. Most node operators don\u2019t want to write much software, and it\u2019s a technical challenge for anyone to independently write compatible implementations of any consensus protocol even if they have a specification. As a result, node operators rely on software repositories (usually hosted on Microsoft/Github servers) to provide them with the software they choose to run. \u201cCore developers\u201d of a blockchain are software developers who work on the software that implement that protocol. Developers have processes that are supposed to assure the quality of the software they release, and are generally very interested in maintaining the legitimacy of their software repositories because they want to see people using their software (as opposed to someone else\u2019s). Critical Components of Governance 1. Incentives Each group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power. 2. Mechanisms for Coordination Since it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another, it creates power imbalances in their favor. In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains (such as Tezos or Polkadot), on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed. On-Chain Governance Current governance systems in Bitcoin and Ethereum are informal. They were designed using a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original paper. Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). What is on-chain governance? On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change. How does it work? Unlike informal governance systems, which use a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems solely work online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. If the change is accepted, it is included in the blockchain and baselined. In some instances of on-chain governance implementation, the updated code may be rolled back to its version before a baseline, if the proposed change is unsuccessful. Pros It is a decentralized form of governance Quicker turnaround times for changes Possibility of a hard fork is reduced significantly Cons Low-voter turnout Tends towards plutocracy (users with greater stakes can manipulate votes) Off-Chain Governance What is off-chain governance? Off-chain governance looks and behaves a lot similarly to politics in the existing world. Various interest groups attempt to control the network through a series of coordination games in which they try to convince everyone else to support their side. There is no code that binds these groups to specific behaviors, but rather, they choose what\u2019s in their best interest given the known preferences of the other stakeholders. There\u2019s a reason blockchain technology and game theory are so interwoven. How does it work? Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). The various stakeholders signal their approval or disapproval for an improvement proposal through private and community discourse. Then, the core developers get a sense for whether or not node operators and miners will agree to upgrade their software. Ideally, all sides agree and the code changes are made smoothly. Everything is announced beforehand and stakeholders have time to update. In the case of disagreement, stakeholders have two options. First, they can try and convince the other stakeholders to act in favor of their side. If they can\u2019t reach consensus, they have the ability to hard fork the protocol and keep or change features they think are necessary. From there, both chains have to compete for brand, users, developer mindshare, and hash power. Resources Why on-chain governance?

Summary Ether (ETH or \u039e) is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. A planned upgrade to the Ethereum protocol in 2019-2021 would replace mining with a less computationally expensive Proof of Stake mechanism which will be secured by validators, who are also expected to receive a proportional compensation in Ether. Ether also has many current use cases, such as a store of value (e.g. in lending collateral), a medium of exchange (e.g. in trade and payments), and a unit of account (e.g. in digital marketplaces). Ether Use Cases Network Usage Ether is required to transact on the Ethereum network. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is the unit used to measure the computational power required to process a transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners are expected to be compensated for this task. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21,000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Store of Value Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors. It is used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions, including: used to pay Ethereum transaction fees (in the form of \u2018gas\u2019), used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications (MakerDAO, Compound), can be lent or borrowed (Dharma), accepted as payment by certain retailers and service providers use it as a medium of exchange to purchase Ethereum-based tokens (via ICOs or exchanges), crypto-collectibles, in-game items, and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs) earned as a reward for completing bounties (Gitcoin, Bounties Network). Furthermore, in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), users will be able to become a validator and help secure the network by providing computational resources and locking up 32 Ether per validator. Due to this, it is expected that Proof of Stake will lock a substantial amount of the circulating supply of Ether. There are also discussions around introducing a \u2018fee-burn\u2019 model where a percentage of Ether used to pay transaction fees would be \u2018burned\u2019 and thus reduce the circulating supply of Ether. In addition to utility value, Ether also has speculative value. This is value that is derived from speculative activities (such as trading and investing) which currently accounts for most of the value behind all crypto-assets. As observed in 2017, crypto-assets can attract substantial speculative interest, with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months. This speculative interest often brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals, but it can be damaging to the short-term market sentiment of all crypto-assets. Can\u2019t tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether? Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called \u2018economic abstraction\u2019 (a good primer can be found here . This would involve miners / validators accepting tokens other than Ether in exchange for adding valid transactions to new blocks. It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it could potentially reduce the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of Ether. How does valuable Ether help to secure the network? In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work (in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations (commonly referred to as \u201cmining farms\u201d) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network (once it reaches a certain size). Miners can also join \u2018mining pools\u2019 in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards. It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack or take control of either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains When Ethereum transitions to Proof of stake under Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that users will be able to stake 32 Ether per validator and receive rewards for their work in the form of additional Ether (at a dynamic issuance rate , discussed later in this essay). Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be tied to the cost of Ether. Instead of using energy intensive mining (as it is under Proof of Work), validators will \u201cstake\u201d Ether, and will lose part or all of their stake if they attempt to behave fraudulently. The more validators with staked Ether securing the network, the more Ether an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack. Such an attack would likely rapidly increase the price of Ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker. Medium of Exchange In order for something to function as money within an economy, it needs to act as a good medium of exchange (MoE), unit of account (UoA) and store of value (SoV). Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy for a wide range of apps, with dApp providers accepting it in exchange for fungible / non-fungible tokens, or other services. It is also used as a unit of account by various parties (including companies that have raised Ether via ICOs). Finally, Ether has historically been used as a store of value, with investors and speculators purchasing Ether to hold for investment purposes, given its relative scarcity, predictable supply growth, and inherent utility. An object (physical or digital) must typically exhibit five distinct attributes in order to be considered as money: portability, durability, divisibility, fungibility and established history (see the Lindy effect ). Ether is highly portable (because it\u2019s digital), durable (again, because it\u2019s digital), divisible (up to 18 decimal places), but has limited fungibility as ETH tokens are interchangeable with one another, but accounts/addresses can be blacklisted quite easily. Privacy protocols such as zk-SNARKs will eventually improve this property for Ethereum. Ethereum has been in operation since 2015 and continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network (and Ether) have functioned as expected for 99.99% of its life. The other 0.01% includes surviving The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a recent 94% drop in price). On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permission-less, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks. The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0). In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it may dilute the value of Ether for those that are not validators. Though, this is offset by Ether being taken out of the circulating supply through staking, various open finance applications, fee burning, and people simply losing access to their Ether.

The other 0.01% includes surviving The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a recent 94% drop in price). On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permission-less, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks. The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0). In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it may dilute the value of Ether for those that are not validators. Though, this is offset by Ether being taken out of the circulating supply through staking, various open finance applications, fee burning, and people simply losing access to their Ether.","title":"Medium of Exchange"},{"location":"DAO-basics/what-is-a-DAO/#resources","text":"Why Ether is Valuable Ether: A New Model for Money","title":"Resources"},{"location":"DAO-basics/what-is-ethereum/","text":"What is Ethereum? Summary Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed ledger featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It enables developers to build blockchain applications with business logic that execute in a trustless environment, while leveraging the high availability of the Ethereum network. Why does it matter? Because it opens the door to a global financial system where an Internet connection is all you need to access applications, products and services that operate in a trustless manner. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum network and participate in this digital economy, without the need for third parties and without the risk of censorship. What are Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications? While the word \"contract\" brings to mind legal agreements; in Ethereum \"smart contracts\" are just pieces of code that run on the blockchain and are guaranteed to produce the same result for everyone who runs them. These can be used to create a wide range of Decentralized Applications (DApps) which can include games, digital collectibles, online-voting systems, financial products and many others. The term \"Smart Contract\" was coined by Nick Szabo in the 90's. Szabo used the basic example of a vending machine to describe how real-world contractual obligations can be programmed into software and hardware systems. Everyone who puts the correct amount of coins into the machine can expect to receive a product in exchange. Similarly, on Ethereum, contracts can hold value and unlock it only if specific conditions are met. The scripting language used by Ethereum is Turing-complete, essentially meaning that the types of DApps users can design is limited only by their programming skills and creativity.

Most applications today fall into the following categories. Decentralized Finance Decentralized finance refers to a number of decentralized protocols building open financial infrastructure. These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. Oracles Oracles refers to a protocols or services to connect Ethereum to offchain information. They can be utilized for querying information from the internet (e.g. API calls), information about other chains (e.g. BTC transactions), or even as dispute resolution mechanisms concerning non-native assets. Decentralized Exchanges Decentralized Exchanges allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences. Gaming Blockchain games are any games that include blockchain technology in its backend or mechanics in general. Collectibles Crypto collectibles are unique items that adhere to the ERC-721 standard. They can be collected and perhaps used across many different games and applications built on Ethereum. Marketplaces Marketplaces built on Ethereum allow for the trading of ERC-721 tokens such as crypto collectibles. Developer Tools A suite of developer tools allow for better standards and easy implementation of these standards across many different applications. Identity Identity is a very important aspect to the future of Ethereum. The Ethereum network hosts many DApps that are building identity systems. These DApps leverage the secure and decentralized nature of the Ethereum network often in collaboration with decentralized storage protocols such as IPFS or SWARM to enable empower and protect consumers' information. Citizens will be able to confidentionally reveal personal information such as Gov.

A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they\u2019re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the effects of price volatility, thus they seek to function as a store of value and a unit of account. To minimize volatility the value of a stablecoin can be pegged to a currency, or to exchange traded commodities (such as precious metals or industrial metals). Stablecoins backed by currencies or commodities directly are said to be centralized, whereas those leveraging other cryptocurrencies are referred to as decentralized. Types of Stablecoins Currency-backed Cryptocurrencies backed by currency (fiat) are the most common and were the first type of stablecoins on the market. Their characteristics are: Their value is pegged to one or more currencies (most commonly the US dollar, also the Euro and the Swiss franc). The peg is realized off-chain, through banks or other types of regulated financial institutions which serve as depositaries of the currency used to back the stablecoin.

Notable currency-backed stablecoins: Gemini Dollar USD Coin Tether TrueUSD Paxos Standard Collateralized (crypto-backed) Cryptocurrency backed stablecoins are issued with cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is conceptually similar to fiat-backed stablecoins. However, the significant difference between the two designs is that while fiat collateralization typically happens off the blockchain, the cryptocurrency or crypto asset used to back this type of stablecoins is done on the blockchain, using smart contracts in a more decentralized fashion.

The supply of algorithmic stablecoins is typically controlled by issuing and destroying coins depending on the market demand, until the target price is reached.

Answer In the US, the SEC has not issued a formal ruling, but recent comments suggest that they do not believe Ether is a security. Other jurisdictions have not made this distinction clear. Explanation Note: this question answers whether Ether fits the legal definition of a security. In the US, the SEC uses the Howey test to determine whether something can be legally considered a security. The test comes from the Supreme Court ruling in 1946 for SEC v. W.J. Howey Co . It stipulates four criteria: Requires investment of money (fiat currency) Money invested with expectation of profit Invested money goes toward a common enterprise Profit is generated by the efforts of a promoter or third party Ether easily fits the first two criteria. People buy Ether with fiat currency, and many do so with the expectation of profit. However, the second two criteria are more difficult to prove. First, money used to purchase Ether does not necessarily go toward a common enterprise. In its current form, purchased Ether only permits usage of the network, not ownership to an enterprise. This condition may change under Proof-of-Stake given that Ether offers people the ability to earn returns while securing the network. Even so, this feature does not fit cleanly into the traditional definition of a common enterprise. Second, Ethereum does not generate profit, nor does it rely on the efforts of a promoter or third party. Ethereum is a network, not a corporation, so it does not produce identifiable profits beyond the value appreciation of Ether. The value of Ether also originates from open source development. While Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation contribute to Ethereum's development, so do many unaffiliated entities and individuals. As such, it is difficult to argue that Ether generates a profit based on efforts of a third party. While the SEC has not formally ruled on the legal status of Ether, comments from regulators in 2018 suggest that they see a compelling case to argue against classifying Ether as a security. Quotes from regulators \"And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. ...

Ether is necessary for Ethereum network security and operational efficiency for miners. Explanation The notion that transaction fees on Ethereum can be paid in-protocol by something other than ether (such as an ERC20 token) is called 'economic abstraction'. We explain why the Ethereum protocol is unlikely to integrate economic abstraction below. Economic abstraction is often used to argue that the value of Ether will go to 0. The theory is that users could pay their transaction costs to miners in something other than Ether. Therefore, if that becomes rampant, Ether itself would have no value. This argument can be used on any Proof-of-Work blockchain, it's an especially popular criticism against Ethereum since it appears easy to create additional ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged for Ether. Quick recap on how transactions work on Ethereum. Each transaction uses a set amount of gas. Users pay miners to include their transaction using a gas price. Gas * Gas Price = transaction cost. The base protocol assumes gas price in ETH and every wallet calculates transaction cost in total ETH to pay. The argument against ETH value begins here. It says that users could pay their transaction cost in some currency or token instead of Ether, including digital USD. Miners could then directly sell tokens or currency into the currency of their choice. While rebuilding Ethereum to accept multiple currencies (even USD) is theoretically possible, this argument ignores how digital native tokens like Ether or Bitcoin act as a layer of security for the system. Tokens like Ether reduce the profitability of network hacks by tying network security to the value of the network's medium of exchange. If network security gets hit, so does the value of the token transacted on the network. Imagine a rogue miner on Ethereum gathers enough computing power to successfully 51% attack the network and divert the network's currency to a personal account. If the currency's value isn't tied to network security (say, USD), the hacker could easily sell these proceeds at full value in reasonably liquid markets. This cannot happen with Ether. Other miners would see this behavior immediately and make it known to relevant markets for Ether. As a result, not only would prices for Ether drop, Ether would also become highly illiquid, making it difficult for the hacker to make off with the pre-hack market value of the stolen Ether. This argument applies for any decentralized blockchain, including Bitcoin. Practically speaking, paying with multiple currencies also adds friction, cost, and a UX nightmare to the operations of a miner. It would have to go through the following process: Open communication with a miner Manually calc the cost of the tx in that tokens value Send miner payment & wait for confirm Execute initial TX and get the nonce Tell the miner the nonce and wait for his next block On top of the added friction to users mentioned above, there is an added cost to users to pay for their transaction in something other than ETH. Sending ETH in a transaction costs 21000 gas while sending tokens costs 40000 gas or more. Calculating gas cost and understanding the gas market is no easy task. Wallets have spent years making this UX smooth. There is no incentive for a wallet to streamline the payment of gas in tokens as the complexities are deep. Now let's talk about miners. Miners are trying to make a profit and have to pay for hardware/electricity costs. They do not want to have a portfolio of 50 different cryptocurrencies with wild volatility and no liquidity. This creates an operational nightmare. As mentioned, this is possible on all PoW chains. Bitcoin even has a tool that enables users to pay for transaction speed in payments other than BTC http://confirmtx.com . However, because of the arguments above, it's not rampant in BTC or ETH because it violates core security assumptions and has extreme practical limitations for miners.

Yes, transactions and data stored within the Ethereum blockchain are immutable. Immutability and The DAO Hard Fork Hard forks do not affect immutability because the data is still accessible and unchanged on the original chain. In the event of a fork, users have the choice to use either fork. Users form a social consensus around which chain is worth using and supporting in the event of a fork. A forked chain is simply a new blockchain with different consensus rules that is entirely immutable according to its ruleset. \"As a trivial example, the only thing the DAO fork did was insert a set of value transfers from one account to another, but that still has the result that transactions (by the attacker) that would have succeeded will now fail with insufficient funds.

In the event of a fork, users have the choice to use either fork. Users form a social consensus around which chain is worth using and supporting in the event of a fork. A forked chain is simply a new blockchain with different consensus rules that is entirely immutable according to its ruleset. \"As a trivial example, the only thing the DAO fork did was insert a set of value transfers from one account to another, but that still has the result that transactions (by the attacker) that would have succeeded will now fail with insufficient funds.

Answer No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices. Explanation Basics of a transaction There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question. First, it's essential to understand how an Ethereum transaction works. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is a unit used to measure the computational power required to process the transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners expect to be compensated. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Fee market Currently, the Ethereum network is working at or near capacity. This means that a fee market is created because some users may be willing to pay more to get to the front of the line while others may not be in as big of a rush. Tools such as EthGasStation offer a great view into the current fee market and what it current costs to get a basic or fast transaction through. You'll notice that so far, we haven't talked about fiat or the cost of a transaction in fiat value. That's because at its core, the fee market is independent from the cost of Ether. Users have the ability to send a transaction from 0 gas price all the way to as high as they'd like and miners have the ability to accept the same range. Rising and falling Ether price While the gas market by design is purely Ether related, it'd be misleading to not acknowledge that a lot of users and miners think of their fees in fiat terms. So while the above example may have cost 0.000021 ETH, some users will instead think of that in terms of fiat cost ($0.002793 for instance). This means that the fee market, while independent of fiat prices at its core, will react to moves in Ether prices. If we use the example above and assume price spikes 5x, all of a sudden that transaction will cost $0.0139 in fiat terms. When price spikes (assuming network demand stays the same), users will start to lower their gas price. When price falls (assuming network demand stays the same), miners will start to raise their minimum accepted gas. We can see the fluctuation in average gas price in the past. Network demand As previously mentioned, network demand plays a much larger role on gas price than Ether price. If no one was using the network, gas prices paid would be near 0. If the network is full, gas prices will start to spike. This is an important consideration when trying to draw conclusions between Ether price and gas prices paid.","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises","text":"","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#answer","text":"No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices.","title":"Answer  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#explanation","text":"","title":"Explanation  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#basics-of-a-transaction","text":"There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question.

So what sync mode should you run to get a full Ethereum blockchain with all necessary security? Both Parity and Geth offer options which synchronize a full node starting at the genesis block and executing all transactions. The modes are: parity --no-warp geth --syncmode full These are full nodes because they: Sync the full chain from genesis block Replay all transactions Execute all contracts Recompute the state of each block Keep all historical blocks on disk Keep the most recent state and prunes ancient states When running the full node described above, you are able to rebuild any historical information you want using just your node. There is often much confusion around if a state pruned Ethereum node (above) is a full node and the answer is yes. Pruning ancient state is fine as it is not necessary to most users. If you are looking to run a block explorer or do deep analysis on the blockchain, then you could run an archive node with no pruning so you don't have to always recompute the pruned state.

Summary Ethereum's \"Difficulty Bomb\" refers to a mechanism that, at a predefined block number, increases the difficulty level of puzzles in the Proof of Work mining algorithm resulting in longer than normal block times (and thus less ETH rewards for miners). This mechanism increases the difficulty exponentially over time and eventually leads to what is referred to as the \"Ice Age\" - that is, the chain becomes so difficult to mine that it grinds to a halt and stops producing blocks (freezes). Why the Difficulty Bomb Exists The Difficulty Bomb was originally put in place for a variety of reasons: To act as a deterrant for miners who wish to continue mining the Ethereum 1.0 (Proof of Work) chain once the network moved fully to the Ethereum 2.0 (Proof of Stake) chain To ensure that the core developers of Ethereum 1.0 are \"forced\" to upgrade the network via a hard fork (if only to delay the effects of the bomb) so that the network does not stagnate innovation-wise Technical Details of the Difficulty Bomb Work in progress. Effects of the Difficulty Bomb The effect of the Difficulty Bomb is easily seen in the 'Ethereum Block Time History' chart from Etherscan (you'll notice that it is a step-function that increases block times the longer that it exists on the chain). Is the Difficulty Bomb Still Necessary? There is an open debate as to whether the Difficulty Bomb is still required because Ethereum 2.0 is now being deployed as a seperate blockchain (instead of a direct upgrade to the Ethereum 1.0 chain) and the bomb has been delayed without any fanfare in both the Byzantine and Constantinople network upgrades.

A \"free\" blockchain may not charge the user for the transaction fees directly via gas but they do usually require users to pay fees in a variety of indirect ways.
